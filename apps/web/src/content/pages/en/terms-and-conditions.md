Cogito Software as registered with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce under registration number 98507125 ("Cogito Software", "Quizbee", "Service" or "we") is the provider of the Quizbee, a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application that allows users to generate quizzes from their own educational materials, such as PDF files, notes, and other documents ("User Content"). The customer (including its End Users) or you are hereinafter referred to as the "Customer" or "you".

## 1. Applicability

These Terms and Conditions apply to the Quizbee application and to any other services and products that Quizbee offers or may offer to the Customer ("Service" or "Services"). These Terms and Conditions, together with the Data Processing Addendum and any applicable online offers or subscription details presented on the website, form the full agreement between Quizbee and the Customer ("Agreement").

In case of any deviations between these Terms and Conditions and other documents, these Terms and Conditions shall prevail, unless otherwise agreed between Quizbee and the Customer in writing. If you have any queries, please feel free to contact us using the contact details indicated on our website: https://quizbee.academy.

## 2. Quizbee

Quizbee allows Customers to upload their own educational materials, like PDF files and notes ("User Materials"), to automatically generate interactive quizzes. Customers can:

- Take their own quizzes directly within the application.
- Share their quizzes with other users, and take quizzes created by the Quizbee community.
- Use an AI-powered chat for explanations and further details about the quiz content.

You are solely responsible for the content of any User Materials you upload and any quizzes you choose to share publicly.

Access to the Service is provided through a subscription model, which includes one free plan and two paid plans. Each subscription plan has specific features and usage limits, such as the number of documents that can be processed or quizzes created per month.

Full details of each plan's features, limits, and pricing are clearly outlined on our website: https://quizbee.academy.

## 3. Access

To access and use the Service, you must register for an account by providing the required information. Your Quizbee account is strictly personal and may not be shared with, sold to, or used by any other person.

You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account. This includes keeping your account password confidential. We recommend using a strong password. Where we offer additional security measures, like two-factor authentication, we strongly encourage you to use them.

If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account, you must immediately change your password and notify us.

Quizbee reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account if we have reason to believe it is being shared with others or used in violation of these Terms and Conditions.

## 4. Provision of the Service

Quizbee will make reasonable efforts to provide the Service in a professional manner. The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind.

To operate and deliver the Service, we rely on third-party providers (our "sub-processors"), for example, for cloud hosting and AI processing.

You are responsible for your use of the Quizbee Service, including the User Materials you upload and share. The quizzes and AI chat responses are generated automatically by artificial intelligence and may contain inaccuracies or errors. You are responsible for reviewing all generated content for accuracy before relying on it.

Quizbee is not responsible for any content uploaded or shared by its users. We do not review or endorse user-generated content. Your interaction with quizzes or materials from other users is at your own risk.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Quizbee (including its owner) shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:

(a) your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the Service;

(b) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service, including any user-generated content;

(c) any content obtained from the Service, especially any inaccuracies in quizzes or AI chat responses;

(d) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your content.

In no event shall Quizbee's aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Service exceed the total amount of fees, if any, that you paid us in the three (3) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

This limitation of liability does not apply in cases of Quizbee's willful misconduct or gross negligence.

## 6. Fees and Payment

To access our paid subscription plans, you must pay a fee, which will be billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis ("Subscription Fee"). All current prices and features for each plan are detailed on our website: https://quizbee.academy.

**Key Payment Terms:**

**14-Day Money-Back Guarantee:** If you are a new customer, you are eligible for a full refund if you cancel your paid subscription within 14 days of your very first purchase. To request a refund, you must contact us through our website. This guarantee applies only to your initial subscription and does not apply to any subsequent renewals or plan upgrades.

**Refund Policy After 14 Days:** Except as stated in our 14-day guarantee, all payments are final and non-refundable. After the initial 14-day period has passed, there will be no refunds or credits for partially used periods, downgrades, or unused months.

**Price Changes:** We reserve the right to change our Subscription Fees. We will provide you with at least 30 days' notice of any price changes before they take effect. Your continued use of the Service after a price change constitutes your agreement to pay the new amount.

**Taxes:** All fees are stated in euros (€) and are inclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) and other applicable taxes.

Should you exceed the usage limits of your current plan, you may be required to upgrade to a higher-tier plan to continue using the Service or certain features.

## 7. Payment and Billing

We use Stripe as our exclusive and secure payment processor for all subscription fees.

When you subscribe to a paid plan, you will provide your payment details directly to Stripe. We do not store your full credit or debit card information on our servers.

Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (monthly or annually). You are responsible for keeping your payment information up-to-date. All aspects of your subscription, including payment method updates and cancellations, can be managed directly through your account settings, which are fully integrated with Stripe.

If a payment fails (for example, due to an expired card or insufficient funds), our system, via Stripe, will automatically attempt to re-charge it. If the payment cannot be successfully processed after these attempts, your access to the paid features of the Service will be suspended until a valid payment is made.

We also reserve the right to immediately suspend or terminate your account if you initiate a chargeback.

## 8. Your Rights, Our Rights, and Rules of Use

This section outlines your right to use Quizbee, our ownership of the platform, your ownership of your content, and the strict rules you must follow. Violation of these rules will result in the immediate and permanent termination of your account without a refund.

### 1. Your License to Use Quizbee

Subject to your compliance with these Terms and payment of any applicable fees, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and personal license to use the Quizbee Service for its intended purposes.

### 2. Our Ownership of the Service

All intellectual property rights related to the Quizbee Service itself—including the software, design, branding, algorithms, and all other components—are the exclusive property of Quizbee. This license does not grant you any right to our source code. You agree not to copy, modify, reverse engineer, or create derivative works from our Service.

### 3. Your Content: Ownership, Sharing, and Responsibility

**Your Ownership:** You retain full ownership of the educational materials you upload ("User Materials") and any quizzes generated from them ("Generated Content").

**Default Privacy:** By default, all your content is private. To operate the Service for you, you grant us a limited license to process your User Materials solely to generate your private quizzes and AI chat responses.

**Sharing Options:** You have two ways to share your quizzes:

- **Sharing via Link:** Each quiz has a unique, private link. This link is not public unless you decide to share it. By copying and distributing this link, you are responsible for who sees your quiz. To enable this, you grant us a license to display the quiz to anyone who accesses it through that link.
- **Making a Quiz Public:** You may have the option to publish a quiz to a public library. If and only if you explicitly choose to make a quiz public, you grant Quizbee a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to display, distribute, and use that quiz on our platform and in our marketing.

**Your Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for all content you upload and share. You warrant that you have the rights to this content and that it does not violate any laws or third-party copyrights.

### 4. Acceptable Use Policy (Rules of Conduct)

You agree not to misuse the Quizbee Service. The following actions are strictly prohibited:

- **Misuse of the AI Chat:** The AI chat is exclusively for quiz-related questions. Using it for general conversation, creative writing, or any other off-topic purpose is a direct violation of these terms. We reserve the right to monitor usage and disable this feature for your account if we detect misuse.
- **Copyright Infringement:** Uploading materials you do not have the rights to.
- **Account Sharing:** Your account is for your personal use only. Sharing your login details is forbidden.
- **System Abuse:** Attempting to disrupt our infrastructure, using bots or scrapers, or trying to circumvent your plan's usage limits.
- **Illegal or Harmful Content:** Uploading or sharing anything illegal, hateful, obscene, or defamatory.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to determine if your conduct violates this policy.

## 9. Service Availability and Changes

The Quizbee Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not guarantee any level of uptime, performance, or availability.

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or completely discontinue the Service, or any of its features, at any time, for any reason, and without any notice or liability to you.

If you provide us with any feedback or suggestions, you grant us an unlimited, royalty-free right to use them for any purpose without compensating you.

The Service depends on third-party providers (like hosting and AI services). We are not responsible or liable for any service disruptions or damages caused by these third parties.

## 10. Support

We provide customer support through the contact methods listed on our website. We aim to respond to inquiries in a timely manner but do not guarantee a specific response time or resolution for any issue.

## 11. Subscription, Renewal, and Termination

### 1. Subscription Term and Automatic Renewal

Your subscription to a paid plan is for a specific term, either monthly or annual, as selected by you during purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle for an identical period unless you cancel it.

### 2. Cancellation By You

You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings. The cancellation will become effective at the end of your current billing period. You will retain access to the paid features until that date, and you will not be charged again. As per our refund policy, no refunds will be issued for any remaining time in your subscription term.

### 3. Termination By Us

### 4. Effect of Termination

Upon the termination of your account (either by you or by us), your right to use the Service will cease immediately.

We will permanently delete all your data, including your User Materials and generated quizzes, from our systems within 90 days of termination. It is your responsibility to save any content you wish to keep before your subscription ends.

Termination does not relieve you of any obligation to pay any fees owed to us prior to termination.

## 12. Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time. We will notify you of significant changes by sending an email to the address associated with your account or by posting a notice on our website.

The new terms will become effective on the date specified in the notice. Your continued use of the Service after the changes take effect constitutes your binding acceptance of the new Terms.

If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the Service and cancel your account.

## 13. Data Processing and Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. When you use our Service, you are the "data controller" for the content you upload, and Quizbee acts as the "data processor" on your behalf.

How we collect, use, and process personal data is explained in detail in our Privacy Policy, which is an integral part of this agreement.

You are responsible for ensuring that your User Materials and your use of our AI-powered features comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the EU AI Act.

## 14. Confidentiality

We consider all your uploaded User Materials and non-public quizzes to be your confidential information. We will not view, access, or disclose your confidential information except as necessary to provide the Service, resolve a support issue, or as required by law.

Likewise, you agree to keep any non-public information about the Quizbee Service confidential.

This obligation of confidentiality does not apply to information that:

(a) is or becomes publicly known through no fault of either party;

(b) is required to be disclosed by law or a court order.

## 15. Final Legal Provisions

### Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands. Any disputes arising from or related to these Terms shall be resolved exclusively in the competent court in the district where Quizbee is registered.

### Assignment

We may transfer or assign our rights and obligations under these Terms to another company or person (for example, if we are acquired) without your consent. You may not transfer or assign your account or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to any other person without our prior written consent.

### Communication

Any official notices or communications from us to you will be sent to the email address associated with your Quizbee account. This will be considered "in writing".

### Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Quizbee regarding the Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements.

## Data Processing Addendum (DPA)

### 1. Background and Interpretation

This Data Processing Addendum ("DPA") is part of our main Terms and Conditions ("Agreement") and explains our obligations as a data processor when we handle your personal data to provide the Quizbee Service.

All terms of the Agreement, including the "Limitation of Liability" section, apply fully to this DPA. This DPA is a legally binding contract required under the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 ("GDPR").

### 2. Roles and Processing Details

Under GDPR, our roles regarding your data are very clear:

**You (the Customer) are the "Data Controller".**  
This is because you are the one who decides which data to upload (your "User Materials") and for what purpose (to create quizzes).

**We (Quizbee) are the "Data Processor".**  
We only process the data on your behalf and according to your instructions.

Your instructions are given to us when you use the Service, for example, when you upload User Materials, create a quiz, or use the AI chat. We will only process your personal data to provide, maintain, and improve the Quizbee Service, and we will not process it for any other purpose.

All terms used in this DPA (like "personal data", "processing", "controller", "processor") have the same meaning as in Article 4 of the GDPR.

### 3. Details and Scope of Processing

This section outlines the specifics of the data processing we perform on your behalf, as required by Article 28(3) of the GDPR.

**Subject-Matter and Purpose of Processing:**

The purpose of our data processing is strictly limited to providing the Quizbee Service as described in our Agreement. This includes:

- Creating and managing your user account.
- Processing your "User Materials" (e.g., PDFs, notes) with our AI model to generate quizzes and provide chat responses.
- Processing payments for our subscription services through our provider, Stripe.
- Communicating with you for customer support and service-related notices.

**Duration of Processing:**

We will process your personal data for the duration of the Agreement (i.e., as long as your account is active) and until the data is deleted in accordance with our data deletion policy (90 days after termination).

**Nature of Processing:**

The processing activities include collecting, storing, analyzing (by the AI), generating, and displaying data as necessary to perform the Service.

**Types of Personal Data Processed:**

- **Account Data:** Your email address and password, or the information associated with your Google Account used for sign-in (e.g., email, unique identifier).
- **User-Provided Content Data:** Any and all personal data that may be contained within the documents, notes, and other materials you upload to the Service ("User Materials"). This could include names, dates, locations, contact details, or any other type of personal information. As the Data Controller, you are responsible for the content of these materials.
- **Payment Information:** We do not collect or store your credit card details. This information is provided directly to our payment processor, Stripe, who handles all payment-related processing. We only process information related to your subscription status (e.g., active, cancelled).

**Categories of Data Subjects (Whose data is being processed):**

- The Customer: The registered user of the Quizbee service.
- Third Parties: Any other individuals whose personal data is included by the Customer in the User Materials they upload.

### 4. Security Measures

In accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR, we implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

These measures include, but are not limited to:

- **Encryption in Transit:** All data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted using industry-standard TLS (HTTPS).
- **Encryption at Rest:** Your "User Materials" and generated content are encrypted when stored on our servers.
- **Access Control:** Access to your personal data is strictly limited to authorized Quizbee personnel who require it to perform their duties (e.g., for customer support).
- **Password Security:** We never store your password in plain text. It is securely hashed using a strong, one-way algorithm.
- **Secure Infrastructure:** Our Service is hosted on the secure infrastructure of our provider, Hetzner, which employs its own robust physical and network security measures.

**Your Responsibility:**

While we take significant steps to secure your data, we do not guarantee that security is effective under all circumstances. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your own account, which includes using a strong, unique password and keeping it confidential.

### 5. Confidentiality

We treat all your "User Materials" and generated quizzes as your confidential information.

Any Quizbee personnel (including the founder) authorized to access your personal data are committed to strict confidentiality obligations.

We will not access or disclose your confidential information to any third party, except under these limited circumstances:

(a) To provide the Service and offer customer support when you request it.

(b) To engage our sub-processors (as detailed in this DPA).

(c) If we are required to do so by law or a valid court order.

### 6. Data Storage and International Transfers

**Primary Data Storage Location:**

Our primary servers are hosted with Hetzner and are located in Germany, which is within the European Economic Area (EEA). This means your uploaded "User Materials" and generated quizzes are stored by default within the high data protection standards of the EU.

**International Transfers for Specific Functions:**

However, to provide certain functionalities of the Service, we use specialized third-party providers (our "sub-processors"), such as our AI model provider. Some of these providers may process your data outside of the EEA (for example, in the United States).

When we transfer data to a sub-processor located outside the EEA, we ensure that the transfer is protected by appropriate legal safeguards, as required by GDPR. This is typically achieved by entering into the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with the sub-processor.

A full list of our sub-processors and their locations is provided in Annex 1 of this DPA.

### 7. Engaging Sub-processors

To provide the Quizbee Service, we rely on a limited number of third-party companies that process your data on our behalf (our "Sub-processors"). These include our hosting provider, AI model provider, and payment processor.

By using our Service, you give us your general written authorization to engage the Sub-processors listed in Annex 1 of this DPA.

We have signed data processing agreements with each of our Sub-processors to ensure they provide a level of data protection that is consistent with this DPA and GDPR. We remain fully liable to you for the performance of our Sub-processors.

If we plan to add a new Sub-processor, we will update the list in Annex 1 and provide you with at least 14 days' notice (usually via email). If you continue to use the Service after this period, you will be deemed to have accepted the new Sub-processor. If you object, your only remedy is to terminate your account.

### 8. Your Responsibilities and Our Assistance

As the Data Controller, you have certain obligations under GDPR. Our role is to assist you as follows:

**Data Subject Requests:**

Sometimes, an individual whose data is contained within your "User Materials" might contact us directly to exercise their rights under GDPR (e.g., a request for deletion).

In this event, we will not respond to them directly. We will promptly forward the request to you. You are solely responsible for responding to and fulfilling such requests.

**General Assistance:**

Taking into account the nature of our Service, we will provide you with reasonable assistance to help you meet your own obligations under GDPR (such as dealing with data security and breaches). We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for any significant assistance provided under this section.

### 9. Audit and Compliance

GDPR gives you (the Data Controller) the right to verify our compliance with our data processing obligations.

To meet this requirement, we will provide you, upon your written request, with our available documentation, certifications (if any), and other relevant information that demonstrates our compliance with this DPA.

If this information is not sufficient for you to verify our compliance, and you have a legitimate reason to request an audit, we can mutually agree on an audit to be conducted by an independent, certified third-party auditor. This audit will be conducted at your expense and must be scheduled at least 30 days in advance, with minimal disruption to our business operations.

### 10. Personal Data Breach

In the event of a "personal data breach" (as defined in GDPR) affecting your data, we will notify you without undue delay after becoming aware of the breach.

Our notification will, to the extent the information is available to us, describe:

- The nature of the personal data breach.
- The likely consequences of the breach.
- The measures we have taken or propose to take to address the breach.

You, as the Data Controller, are solely responsible for notifying any relevant supervisory authorities and/or affected data subjects, as may be required under GDPR.

### 11. Data Deletion Upon Termination

Upon termination of the Agreement for any reason, we will permanently delete all personal data in our possession, including your "User Materials" and generated quizzes, within 90 days following the date of termination.

It is your sole responsibility to export or save any data you wish to retain before your account is terminated.

We have no obligation to assist with data recovery after your account is terminated, and any data deleted is irrecoverable.
