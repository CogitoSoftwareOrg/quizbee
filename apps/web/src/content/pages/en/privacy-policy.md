# Privacy Policy for Quizbee

**Last Updated: 21.10.2025**

Your privacy and the protection of your personal data is of great importance to us at Quizbee. In this Privacy Policy, we describe what information we collect from you when you use our website (quizbee.academy) and our services, and how we use that information.

We process your personal data in accordance with the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This means we:

- Clearly state our purposes before we process your data.
- Limit our data collection to only what is necessary to provide our service.
- Ask for your explicit consent when required.
- Take appropriate security measures to protect your data and demand the same from our partners.
- Respect your rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data.

## For What Purposes Do We Use Your Personal Data?

We collect and process your data for several specific purposes. Below, we explain what data we use and why.

### 1. To Create and Manage Your Account

To use Quizbee, you need to create an account. For this purpose, we process:

- **Data:** Your email address and a securely hashed password, or your Google Account information if you use Google Sign-In.
- **Purpose:** To allow you to log in, manage your account, and secure your access.
- **Retention:** We store this information until you delete your account.

### 2. To Provide the Quizbee Service (Quiz Generation)

The core function of our service is to generate quizzes from your materials. For this, we process:

- **Data:** The full content of the documents and notes you upload ("User Materials"). This may include any type of personal data contained within them.
- **Purpose:** To analyze the text with our AI model and generate relevant quizzes and AI chat responses for you.
- **Retention:** We store this data as long as your account is active, and it is deleted within 90 days after you close your account.

### 3. To Process Payments

To use our paid plans, you need to provide payment information.

- **Data:** We do not collect or store your full credit card information. This is handled directly and securely by our payment processor, Stripe. We only receive information like your subscription status and transaction history.
- **Purpose:** To manage your subscription and process payments.
- **Retention:** While we don't store payment details, we are legally required by Dutch law to keep records of financial transactions for 7 years for tax purposes.

### 4. To Communicate With You

When you contact us for support or we need to send you service-related information.

- **Data:** Your name (if provided), email address, and the content of your messages to us.
- **Purpose:** To provide customer support and send important notices about your account or our service.
- **Retention:** We store support communications for up to one year after your account is closed to handle any follow-up questions.

## Providing Data to Third Parties (Our Sub-processors)

We do not sell your personal data. We only share it with third-party companies when it is necessary to provide our service. These partners are our "sub-processors," and we have legally binding agreements with them to protect your data.

Our sub-processors are listed in Annex 1 of our Data Processing Addendum (DPA). They include:

- Cloud & AI service providers (e.g., Hetzner, OpenAI)
- Payment service providers (Stripe)
- Email service providers (MailerSend)
- Product analytics providers (PostHog)

We may be legally required to share your data with authorities if there is a suspicion of a crime.

### International Data Transfers

Our main servers are in the EU (Germany). However, some of our sub-processors (like our AI provider) are based outside the EU. When we transfer data internationally, we use legal safeguards like the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to ensure your data remains protected to GDPR standards.

## Google's Limited Use Requirements

If you sign in using your Google Account, our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.

## Cookies

We use cookies on our website to make it work, analyze usage, and improve your experience.

- **Essential Cookies:** These are necessary for the website to function (e.g., keeping you logged in).
- **Analytics Cookies:** These help us understand how users interact with our site so we can improve it (e.g., PostHog).

When you first visit our site, we will ask for your consent to use non-essential cookies via a cookie banner. You can manage your cookie preferences at any time through your browser settings.

## Your Rights

- **Right of Access:** You can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
- **Right of Rectification:** You can ask us to correct any inaccurate information.
- **Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):** You can request that we delete your personal data.
